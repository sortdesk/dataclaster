# TODOs

- [ ] Maybe some `as_list` parameter for `XML_Config`
- [ ] Docstrings + type annotations + marking methods as private
- [x] Type casting
- [ ] Type casting for complex types
- [ ] Add a license
- [ ] Some functionality needs to be moved to a generic mixin (like data casting)
- [ ] Reorder methods
- [ ] Implement some sort of validation of the `Config` objects, i.e. you can't pass `list_config` along with other args
